  <h1>Reporting Fraud and Abuse</h1>
</div>

<p>The Board of Education (BOE) wants Howard County residents to have the highest trust in the public officials and employees of the Howard County Public School System (HCPSS). Therefore, the Board expects school system employees to conduct themselves in a responsible, ethical manner at all times in the performance of their duties and to serve as good stewards of public funds.</p>

<section class="callout-border-prim--left">
<h2>Definition of Fraud and Abuse</h2>
  <p>Obtaining property owned by or under the control of the Board by means of false pretenses or representation including, but not limited to, bribery, kickbacks, illegal acts, forgery, theft, or embezzlement.</p>
</section>

<p>Expected behavior for Board members and employees is explained in <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/f/board/policies/2070.pdf">BOE Policy 2070</a>.</p>

<p>To deter fraud and abuse and ensure the appropriate use of public funds and resources, the HCPSS has established a Fraud Hotline. The HCPSS has contracted with an independent company, Global Compliance, to provide an easy, confidential way for Howard County residents and employees to report possible fraud and abuse. In filling a report, a person may choose to remain anonymous or to leave their name and information so the HCPSS can contact them if more information is needed.  In either case, the information will be treated confidentially.</p>

  <h3>Reporting By HCPSS Employees</h3>
