  	<h3>Public Hearing Written Testimony</h3>
  	<p>Any individual testifying at a public hearing is asked to provide written testimony. Individuals may also submit written testimony via USPS mail or emailed to <a href="mailto:boe@hcpss.org">boe@hcpss.org</a>. All testimony is part of the public record maintained by the Board Office. </p>
  	<p>Effective July 1, all testimony submitted for public hearings will be uploaded<strong> as submitted</strong> to <a href="http://www.boarddocs.com/mabe/hcpssmd/Board.nsf/public">BoardDocs</a>. Written testimony will not be edited before posting online—no personal information will be removed. It is recommended that written testimony submitted at the public hearing only include the constituent’s name.</p>
  	<p>It is highly recommended that testimony sent via email be submitted as an attachment with only the constituent’s name included. Only the attachment will be posted online. If testimony is submitted in the text of an email, the entire email—including the constituent’s email address—will be posted. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-right">
  <h3>Public Forum Written Testimony</h3>
    <p>Also effective July 1, all written comments submitted during Public Forum will be uploaded into BoardDocs. Again, no personal information will be removed. It is recommended that comments submitted only include the constituent’s name. Comments submitted are a part of the public record maintained by the Board Office.</p>
    <p>Please contact the Board of Education Office at 410-313-7194 with any questions or concerns.</p>
